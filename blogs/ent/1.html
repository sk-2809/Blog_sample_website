                    <p>Those were the exact words Netflix’s Co-founder, Marc Randolph, used to answer the question of
                        how they came up with the name Netflix.
                        In a recent podcast interview with Mindvalley’s Vishen Lakhiani, Marc shared with us the story
                        behind how Netflix went from concept to company.
                        He traveled way back in time to when he and his eventual co-founder Reed Hastings would carpool
                        in the Bay area and, every day, Marc would pitch Reed a new business idea. Some ideas were not
                        so great — customized baseball bats and customized shampoo. Other ideas transformed into
                        something much greater — Netflix.
                        Marc Randolph was 38 years old when he started Netflix, but he had successfully launched over
                        five ventures beforehand.
                        Here are 5 pieces of advice from the co-founder of Netflix, a company founded in 1998, that is
                        now generating over 20.16 billion USD in annual revenue.</p>

                    <h2><strong>1. Start now and start small; never leave an idea in your head.</strong></h2>
                    <p>There’s nothing more damaging to aspiring entrepreneurs than mere inaction. I can attest to this
                        myself as I spent the entirety of my mid-twenties talking about starting a business, but I never
                        did.</p>
                    <p>In 2011, at a university competition, I delivered a two-minute elevator pitch about a
                        food-delivery app, won second place, but I did nothing about it. All throughout my time working
                        at Google, all I did with my close friends was entertain start-up ideas, but we never put them
                        in action.</p>
                    <p>That’s why, as soon as I resigned, my single top priority was to finally start a project on my
                        own. And within one year of doing so, I witnessed the greatest professional and personal growth
                        in my life.</p>
                    <p>Here’s the single most important advice Marc Randolph has for you: Stop talking about your ideas
                        or entertaining them in your head.</p>
                    <p>Stop talking and start doing.</p>

                            <span> “You have to figure out how to quickly, easily, and cheaply get your idea out of your
                                head and collide it with reality.”</span>

                        </blockquote>
                    </div>
                    <p>Every idea you have in your head sounds like the next big thing. And the more you think about it,
                        the bigger it becomes. But here’s a reality check: It isn’t. Your idea is incredibly flawed
                        because it has yet to be subject to outside forces. It has yet to solve a person’s problem.</p>
                    <p>So how do you start?</p>
                    <p>In his chat with Vishen, Marc gives an example of a university student who once approached him
                        with the idea to build a peer-to-peer clothing-rental business. His solution was quite simple.
                    </p>
                    <p>He asked her for a pen and a piece of paper and prepared a sign that read:</p>
                    <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                        <blockquote class="text-left-align">
                            <span> “Need to borrow clothes? Knock.”</span>

                        </blockquote>
                    </div>
                    <p>He then told her to slap it on her dorm-room door and see what happens. Just by doing so, and
                        within a few hours, she’ll be able to find out whether or not the idea is viable. If someone
                        knocks, it is.</p>
