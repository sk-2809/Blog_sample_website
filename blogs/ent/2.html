                    <p>Sarah has worked at Guardian Technologies for nearly a decade now. She started out her career at
                        the company as an entry-level sales associate and has since worked her way up to a sales
                        executive.</p>
                    <p>She makes well over $100,000 a year, loves her team, her company and her life as a whole.</p>
                    <p>When her more entrepreneurial friends poke fun at her for being a “nine-to-fiver” or “not
                        dreaming big enough” she doesn’t mind. In fact, she finds it amusing.</p>
                    <p>She deeply respects her friend’s drive to build the next Apple or Facebook… but she couldn’t be
                        happier with her job and her life.</p>
                    <p>She gets nights and weekends off as she watches her friends spend most of their “free time”
                        working.</p>
                    <p>During her late twenties, she has been able to cross countless destinations off her travel bucket
                        list with a hefty 4-weeks worth of vacation each year, while her friends have been locked up in
                        their apartments building and rebuilding and then rebuilding some more after that</p>
                    <p>Not to mention… when she hits her bonuses… she makes more than them combined. But, who is
                        counting?</p>

                    <h3><strong>Let’s have a candid conversation about entrepreneurship vs. “employee-ship”.</strong>
                    </h3>
                    <p>I want to begin by saying the dream to become an entrepreneur isn’t a silly one… not in the
                        least.</p>
                    <p>After all, I chose that path for myself and that decision has allowed me to build JotForm to
                        almost 4 million users over the last 12 years… and it has given me the chance to work with a
                        team of incredible people… a team of incredible employees.</p>
                    <p>However, I would be remiss if I didn’t say the dream to become an “employee” isn’t a silly one
                        either. In fact, there is a great deal of me that would argue it’s a better one for some
                        people..</p>
                    <p>Here’s the single most important advice Marc Randolph has for you: Stop talking about your ideas
                        or entertaining them in your head.</p>
                    <p>Stop talking and start doing.</p>

                    <p>Every idea you have in your head sounds like the next big thing. And the more you think about it,
                        the bigger it becomes. But here’s a reality check: It isn’t. Your idea is incredibly flawed
                        because it has yet to be subject to outside forces. It has yet to solve a person’s problem.</p>
                    <p>So how do you start?</p>
                    <p>In his chat with Vishen, Marc gives an example of a university student who once approached him
                        with the idea to build a peer-to-peer clothing-rental business. His solution was quite simple.
                    </p>
                    <p>He asked her for a pen and a piece of paper and prepared a sign that read:</p>
                    <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                        <blockquote class="text-left-align">
                            <span> “Need to borrow clothes? Knock.”</span>

                        </blockquote>
                    </div>
                    <p>He then told her to slap it on her dorm-room door and see what happens. Just by doing so, and
                        within a few hours, she’ll be able to find out whether or not the idea is viable. If someone
                        knocks, it is.</p>
