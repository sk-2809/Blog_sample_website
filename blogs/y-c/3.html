                    <p>Running a biotech company is capital intensive, and this can make it intimidating to get started.
                        Founders sometimes face a chicken and egg problem: how do you make progress without millions of
                        dollars in funding, and how do you raise millions of dollars in funding without having made
                        progress?</p>
                    <p>However, it is quite possible today to start a biotech company on a shoestring budget ($0-$200k
                        starting costs). Many successful biotech companies started in just this way.</p>
                    <p>This post walks through three such stories, covering three biotech companies that are doing
                        extremely well. Each example explains how they managed to get started and hit initial milestones
                        with minimal funding or without any funding at all.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, these case studies will demonstrate answers to the following questions:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Can you run initial experiments showing technical feasibility of your idea, like
                                GeneWEAVE?</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p> If your target market will be very expensive to enter, can you repurpose your product to
                                go after a smaller, more tractable market initially, like BillionToOne?</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Can you generate revenue upfront by providing services to other companies that are
                                enabled by your technology, like Arpeggio?</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>GeneWEAVE</h2>
                    <p>Today GeneWEAVE is a division of Roche, the world’s largest biotech company and leading provider
                        of in vitro diagnostics. GeneWEAVE’s infectious disease diagnostic products are authorized by
                        the FDA and based on technology that was acquired by Roche in 2015 for $425M. They have a unique
                        diagnostic approach: while most use PCR based techniques to diagnose bacterial infections,
                        GeneWEAVE uses phages (viruses that infect bacteria) as the detection mechanism. The main
                        advantage of this approach is faster, easier and cheaper sample preparation that enables rapid
                        results.</p>
                    <p><strong>The founding of GeneWEAVE, however, is a case study on focus and scrappiness.</strong>
                        Diego Rey, co-founder and CTO of GeneWEAVE needed to show that his phage based diagnostics could
                        work. Intensely focused on demonstrating technical feasibility, he and his co-founders found
                        $75K in grant money and hired a postdoc at Cornell to do the first proof-of-principle study. The
                        study needed to demonstrate that the phage-based bacterial detection technique could work. The
                        initial data took a year to collect, and the results were good. However, this initial data used
                        a lab strain of bacteria and the team had yet to show that the technology could work with
                        bacteria recovered from actual infections — or in their case, drug resistant staph (MRSA).</p>
                    <p>At this point, GeneWEAVE set up a chain of experiments, and used each experiment to raise another
                        small round of funding. Their first investor check was for $150K and they used this to generate
                        more data and convince another investor to also invest $150K. This led to the next experiment
                        which got them another $300K and a final proof point that landed them another $300K. By now the
                        team showed that the tech could work with bacteria found in the real world and directly from
                        patient specimens. This was enough to convince Series A investors to fund the company with $12M.
                    </p>
                    <p>What’s notable about GeneWEAVE is not only what they did, but what they did not do. They focused
                        on their proof of principle, and were not distracted by setting up a facility or starting their
                        FDA 510(k). They defined a first specific product (MRSA screening) and focused on producing key
                        data that de-risked the technology and product one step at a time.</p>
                    <h2>BillionToOne (YC S17)</h2>
                    <p>BillionToOne makes diagnostic blood tests. They have raised over $30M and are working on a
                        product to detect cancer using a blood test.</p>
                    <p>The BillionToOne blood test works using cell free DNA —that is the DNA that is released into the
                        bloodstream when cells die. Cancer cells have detectable mutations that shed into the
                        bloodstream when the cells die. Theoretically, it would be possible to detect those mutations
                        early via blood draw to determine the correct, personalized treatment for every cancer patient.
                    </p>
                    <p>When getting started, BillionToOne decided not to pursue cancer diagnostics as their first
                        product. Instead, they used their core cell free DNA technology for non-invasive prenatal
                        screening (i.e. determining disease in a fetus from a maternal blood sample), a market much
                        easier to enter due to existing reimbursement rules. Similar to cancer cells, placental cells
                        die and release fetal DNA into the mom’s bloodstream. The technology that would look for cancer
                        mutations instead would look for chromosomal abnormalities, as well as other disorders such as
                        sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and spinal muscular atrophy mutations in the prenatal use
                        case.</p>
                    <p>Co-founder and CEO Oguzhan Atay and team joined YC in summer 2017 focused on building a prenatal
                        test. Their prenatal focus was one of the key elements to launching on a budget because prenatal
                        testing can be recommended by doctors and billed to insurance. Though cell free DNA technology
                        can be used to diagnose cancer, the incentives are not yet aligned for a product of this type.
                        For example, there isn’t a CPT code to bill against for a “cancer blood test” for early
                        detection or treatment monitoring, or an agreed upon criteria for testing patients with symptoms
                        for an early diagnosis. Today, cancer screening is intriguing, but a company would have to raise
                        a ton of money to prove diagnostic capability at the level needed to get reimbursed.</p>
                    <p>By focusing on prenatal diagnosis, a category with established care patterns and reimbursable by
                        insurance, they could develop their technology and get paid in a year instead of a decade. To
                        ship their first version, BillionToOne recruited physicians and scientists who were interested
                        in sickle cell prenatal diagnosis, and worked with those physicians to run a clinical study to
                        develop their laboratory developed test (LDT). Because those scientists were excited about the
                        promise of the product, they were willing to do the study on a budget, and all-in-all
                        BillionToOne was able to develop their product and complete their clinical studies for around
                        $2M before raising their $15M Series A to set up their CLIA laboratory and commercialize their
                        test.</p>
                    <h2>In conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, it’s possible to start a bio company on a budget. We hope that a few
                        illustrations will encourage more founders to take their first steps.</p>
