                    <p>A frequent question we get at YC is “when do I start thinking about the FDA?” Obviously, there is
                        no single answer to such a complex question, but here are some basic rules of thumb for how to
                        think about it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>It makes sense for every founder considering a bio product to get a basic FDA education
                                from day one.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Choosing the proper regulatory pathway is nuanced; research and experts can help.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Correctly setting up your GxP process and running studies “the FDA way” at the right time
                                is essential.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Navigating the FDA process effectively is absolutely key for startups. If you invest too much too
                        early, you may unnecessarily burn cash too fast. Conversely, if you start too late, you may have
                        to redo work, potentially slowing down your process substantially. An analogy we often share
                        with founders is that work done before investing in the FDA process is like sketching with
                        pencil, while committing to the FDA process is like using ink. As you can imagine, planning your
                        sketch and practicing it in pencil, and only then committing to ink, will lead to the best
                        results.</p>
                    <p>In our experience, we often see pre-product startup founders pursuing two simultaneous projects:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Running a “killer” experiment that demonstrates that their product can work.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Figuring out the appropriate FDA regulatory pathway for their product.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Startups run these simultaneously because they’re interdependent and because the learnings from
                        the killer experiment often help determine the proper regulatory pathway. Imagine you’ve been
                        iterating on a novel therapeutic in vitro. Your killer experiment might be showing a therapeutic
                        effect by doing an in-vivo experiment in a representative animal model. By getting some sense of
                        the therapeutic effect and its mechanism, you can compare your therapeutic to others with
                        similar safety profiles or that treat similar populations or diseases. This comparison process
                        can help you choose the regulatory pathway that makes the most sense for the product.</p>
                    <p>Over the years, we’ve watched many startups do a lot of work on their “killer experiments” before
                        deciding on their FDA regulatory pathway. These are some of the approaches we’ve seen YC
                        companies pursue:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>In-vitro experiments at the bench, using banked cells or banked/cultured tissues.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In-vivo experiments using animal models.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In patient experiments under IRB with physician oversight.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Finding a non-clinical research use for your technology that does not require FDA
                                approval.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Pursue research, industrial, agricultural, or veterinary applications of technologies
                                that will eventually be used for human health.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When startups have been developing diagnostics, we’ve also seen companies working on tests with a
                        lab component decide to start first with the CLIA/CAP LDT process, and only then pursue FDA
                        clearance. This can be a reasonable choice for certain classes of diagnostic tests as it allows
                        you to start delivering diagnostic results at small scale.</p>
                    <p>Here are some important questions to consider as you set out on your FDA journey:</p>
                    <strong>
                        <p>When should I start doing things the FDA way (e.g. set up GxP, Quality System etc)?</p>
                    </strong>
                    <p>As we described in a previous post, doing things the FDA way is vital to getting the regulatory
                        green light you need before you can market your product. It’s time-consuming and complex,
                        entailing setting up your quality system, documenting appropriately, and running studies
                        according to tightly controlled protocols. But doing it the right way will expedite the
                        regulatory process.</p>
                    <p>There is no easy answer for exactly when to start doing things the FDA way. Ideally, though, your
                        founders understood at a basic level when they started the company what the process may look
                        like for your product. An early team might have already gathered some data on their product’s
                        safety and efficacy from their killer experiments.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the cost and time associated with your experiments is often a factor in determining
                        the best time to start doing things the FDA way. A company developing a digital health product
                        will usually start the process sooner than a company developing a therapeutic, because the
                        former requires less time and energy if pivoting becomes necessary. Nevertheless, a good rule of
                        thumb for any company to follow is that when your team feels confident that its technology could
                        work, it’s probably the right time to begin thinking about its regulatory implications. And, it
                        may be a good time to seek feedback from the FDA or counsel from a consultant or lawyer.</p>
                    <strong>
                        <p>Should I hire a consultant or a lawyer?</p>
                    </strong>
                    <p>Starting the FDA process can be expensive, so doing smart planning and budgeting can help your
                        startup efficiently navigate the FDA process. If you’re an early-stage company who’s raised only
                        a small seed round or less, seeking advice from a regulatory consultant is a good way to get
                        started. Consultants bring a wealth of regulatory experience, but may not be expert in your
                        domain. Ideally an early stage consultant has experience in both your diagnostic or therapeutic
                        area and the regulatory pathway you’re most seriously considering. And of course, they
                        understand many of the financial and regulatory dynamics companies at your stage are grappling
                        with.</p>
                    <p>To be sure, consultants have different specialties; some focus on therapeutics while others are
                        experts in medical devices and manufacturing or regulated software. There are frequent
                        discussions within the YC bio community about which consultants are good in which areas. If you
                        can’t identify a consultant who meets all three criteria, you can sometimes use one like a
                        lawyer–as a primary outside counsel who is your go-to FDA resource, while hiring specialists on
                        an as-needed basis.</p>
                    <p>However, while there are exceptions, it’s unusual to hire a regulatory-affairs attorney during
                        your company’s early stages. On the other hand, it’s important to retain an intellectual
                        property lawyer early on. We’ll cover that in a future post.</p>
                    <strong>
                        <p>Is a lawyer better than a consultant?</p>
                    </strong>
                    <p>Early stage startup founders often believe a lawyer who specializes in life science regulation is
                        superior to a non-lawyer consultant. Generally, we don’t agree, but a regulatory lawyer can be
                        an immense help when a startup finds itself expecting to challenge an FDA decision such as the
                        agency refusing to sign off on a regulatory pathway for your product while green-lighting a
                        competitor’s process.</p>
                    <strong>
                        <p>What can I hire a consultant to do?</p>
                    </strong>
                    <p>For many early stage bio companies, a consultant is useful for the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Determining the pros and cons of different regulatory options, such as whether to pursue
                                510(k) or DeNovo? Or 505(b)(1) or (b)(2)?</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Whether choosing a Pre-sub or Pre-IND would be beneficial for a product like yours. The
                                consultant can also do the filing and request the meeting with the FDA.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Figuring out what your IND (Investigational New Drug) submission package should look
                                like, including: Is chronic toxicity testing required? How long? Where will it be run?
                                What will your manufacturing look like and where will you do it?</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As with any advisor, the more you arm your consultant with relevant and helpful data about what
                        you want to achieve and what you’ve already done, the more valuable she can be for you.</p>
                    <p>With this information in mind, you can start planning your next steps and building out a budget
                        and timeline. Remember that good consultants can be incredibly expensive. We often see quotes in
                        the $6,000 to $20,000 a month range for part-time consultants. To best manage your costs, you
                        should have specific outcomes in mind before you hire a consultant. This will help you keep
                        their hours under control.</p>
