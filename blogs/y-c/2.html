                    <p>We’re delighted to announce the launch of another YC Build Sprint through Startup School! It will
                        begin on February 15 and end on March 14. Signups just opened, so you can register for the
                        sprint now.</p>
                    <p>The Build Sprint is an opportunity for intense focus on your startup or side-project for a
                        specific period of time. For existing startups, this may involve a push towards launching a
                        specific feature or reaching a certain milestone. For new founders, this is an opportunity to
                        take the plunge and begin work on a project that excites you.</p>

                    <p>At the start of the sprint, you’ll register your four-week goal. As the sprint progresses, you’ll
                        be able to track your progress, get feedback from YC group partners and team members, and have
                        weekly meetings with other sprint participants to provide accountability. The sprint culminates
                        with the YC application deadline.</p>
                    <strong>
                        <p>Getting feedback from YC</p>
                    </strong>
                    <p>One consistent request we get from Startup School participants and YC applicants alike is more
                        feedback from the YC team. For the upcoming sprint, we’re committing to provide more founder
                        feedback than ever before. Each week, we’ll issue a public challenge to sprint participants and
                        give personalized feedback to those who participate. We’ll also have weekly calls with YC
                        partners and experts that will answer participant questions.</p>
                    <p>Finally, in a first for YC, we’ll provide actionable feedback on 1,0001 YC S2021 applications
                        submitted by sprint participants. Historically, we haven’t systematically provided personalized
                        feedback on applications that don’t make it to the interview stage because of resource
                        constraints. In the spirit of doing things that don’t scale, however, we’re going to get it
                        done!</p>
                    <strong>
                        <p>Want a sprint buddy?</p>
                    </strong>
                    <p>If like many aspiring founders you haven’t gotten started because you haven’t found the right
                        person to work with yet, we’d like to help! As part of Startup School, we recently launched a
                        (still in beta) co-founder matching service. We expect most successful co-founder relationships
                        will take months or years to build a strong foundation, but working on a Build Sprint project
                        together is a great way to stress test a new relationship. If this sounds interesting to you,
                        sign up for Startup School and create a co-founder matching profile now.</p>
