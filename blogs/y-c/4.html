                    <p>In the late 1990s, Deryl McKissack visited a high school in Washington, DC, to speak to the
                        student body about her career. At the start of that decade, she had founded her architecture,
                        engineering, and construction management firm in the U.S. capital, inspired by her family’s
                        115-year-old business. When she walked into one of the school’s restrooms after her talk,
                        McKissack was struck by its deteriorated state. She thought about the young women walking
                        through those doors every day and the effect these conditions could have on their
                        self-confidence — and she realized her purpose as a leader was to improve lives through building
                        and design.</p>

                    <p>Today, as president and CEO, McKissack sits at the helm of a leading design and construction
                        services group with US$30 million in annual revenue. McKissack & McKissack has offices in
                        Baltimore, Chicago, DC, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Austin, with 150 employees managing $15 billion
                        in construction projects and serving customers across the U.S. and around the globe. The firm,
                        renowned for such landmark projects as the George H.W. Bush Library, the Martin Luther King, Jr.
                        Memorial, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, has been doing steady
                        business during the pandemic as commercial and public organizations rethink buildings and
                        infrastructure for the post-pandemic world.</p>
                    <p>he challenges McKissack has faced as the founder of a minority-owned business have instilled an
                        ingenuity and resilience that cascade through her company’s culture, and that have been critical
                        in addressing the evolving needs of businesses and individuals for the physical spaces they
                        inhabit. She sat down for a Zoom interview with strategy+business to discuss how McKissack &
                        McKissack is adapting to the pandemic’s disruption both internally and as an industry leader.

                        <p>S+B: Your firm has a unique origin story. Can you tell us about that?</p>
                    </strong>
                    <p><strong>MCKISSACK: </strong>My family’s history in America goes back to 1790, when my
                        great-great-grandfather came here as a slave. He was a builder. He made bricks. He passed this
                        trade down to my great-grandfather, who became a master carpenter, who passed his trade down to
                        my grandfather. My grandfather and his brother started our family business in Tennessee in 1905,
                        making us the oldest African-American architectural firm in the country. In 1922, they became
                        the first licensed Black architects in the Southeast United States. But what put them on the map
                        was the Tuskegee Air Force Base that they designed and built during World War II.</p>
                    <p>I’m an identical twin, and one of three girls. From the age of 6, I remember going to the office
                        with my twin sister. My father, a registered architect, would prop us up on the drawing boards.
                        He taught us how to draw details, do schedules, use Leroy lettering [a mechanical lettering
                        device], and make legends. He started using the designs we made by the age of 12 for his real
                        work with customers. When we went to college, he met with the deans of the architecture and
                        engineering schools to design a curriculum just for us, enabling us to graduate in both fields.
                        The plan was that we would work in corporate America and bring the best practices back into the
                        family business.</p>
                    <p>But then it hit me that I wanted my own little red wagon. I just had this burning passion to see
                        if I could do it. Could I start a company with $1,000? I’d never even written a business plan,
                        so I bought a book on how to do it. Although this is my own company, I consider it an extension
                        of my heritage. Design and architecture are in my blood.</p>
